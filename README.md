# get_max_profit
Calculate highest profit from a list of stock values.

The index of the list indicates time passing. The higher the index, the later in the day. Calculate what profit could be made if you were to buy and sell at the listed prices for the highest amount of profit.

For example:

example_list = [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 3]

The answer would be 9 because the biggest profit would come from buying at price 1 and selling at price 10. Note you cannot buy then sell at a time after the price you bought it.
